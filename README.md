\section{Introduction}
This project implements a Waypoint Prediction Model using PyTorch. The model predicts future waypoints based on object features, lane features, and IMU data. The code is designed to be modular and easy to extend.

\section{Requirements}
To run this code, you need the following Python packages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Python 3.7 or higher
    \item PyTorch
    \item NumPy
    \item Pandas
    \item Scikit-learn
    \item Matplotlib
\end{itemize}

You can install the required packages using the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
pip install torch numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
\end{verbatim}

\section{Dataset}
The dataset should be organized in the following structure:
\begin{verbatim}
data_dir/
├── images/
│   ├── sequence_1/
│   ├── sequence_2/
│   └── ...
├── waypoints/
│   ├── sequence_1/
│   ├── sequence_2/
│   └── ...
└── objects/
    ├── sequence_1/
    ├── sequence_2/
    └── ...
\end{verbatim}

Each sequence folder should contain the following files:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{imu\_data.json}: IMU data in JSON format.
    \item \texttt{cametra\_interface\_output.csv}: Object features in CSV format.
    \item \texttt{cametra\_interface\_lanes\_output.csv}: Lane features in CSV format.
    \item \texttt{waypoints.npy}: Waypoints in NumPy format.
\end{itemize}

\section{Code Structure}
The code consists of the following main components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{DrivingDataset}: A PyTorch Dataset class for loading and preprocessing the data.
    \item \texttt{WaypointPredictor}: A neural network model for predicting waypoints.
    \item \texttt{train\_model}: A function to train the model.
    \item \texttt{main}: The main function to execute the training process.
\end{itemize}

\section{Training the Model}
To train the model, run the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
python main.py
\end{verbatim}

The model will be trained for a specified number of epochs, and the training and validation losses will be logged and plotted.

\section{Important Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Random Initialization}: The weights of the model are initialized randomly. This means that the results may vary between runs. It is recommended to run the training process multiple times (e.g., 3-5 times) to ensure stable and accurate results.
    \item \textbf{Checkpoints}: The model saves a checkpoint after the third epoch. You can use this checkpoint to resume training or for inference.
    \item \textbf{Seed for Reproducibility}: If you want reproducible results, you can uncomment the seed-setting code in the script. However, note that this may limit the exploration of different weight initializations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
After training, the model will save the trained weights to \texttt{waypoint\_predictor.pth}. You can load this file for inference or further training. The training and validation losses will be plotted and displayed at the end of the training process.

\section{Conclusion}
This project provides a robust framework for waypoint prediction using deep learning. By running the training process multiple times, you can achieve more accurate and stable results. For any questions or issues, please refer to the code documentation or contact the author.
